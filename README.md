# Introduction

Cyndie Dex is a mock Decentralized Exchange (DEX) tool designed to simulate cryptocurrency token swaps. 

It allows users to interact with different tokens, execute swaps, and determine the best exchange rate across multiple exchanges.

While this tool operates in a mock environment, it provides valuable insights into the workings of a real-world DEX.



## Project's Objectives

* Compare swap prices from multiple mock exchanges -> (Uniswap, Cowswap, Carbon, Sushi, Matcha) 

* Present the best swap rate for the user.

N.B. The mock tool initially focuses on USDC, USDT and BUSD.


## Features

* **User Registration:** Allows users to enter their wallet address and select a preferred network.

* **Token Swapping:** Enables users to swap between different cryptocurrency tokens and view the best exchange rate available.

* **Dynamic Pricing:** Cyndie Dex fetches mock data from multiple exchanges to determine the best swap rate for users.

* **Interactive UI:**  Simple and user-friendly interface that guides users through the swap process.
